# ShopSphere — Final Repository Audit

**Audit date:** 2026-10-06  
**Repository:** `piyushgarg1857/java_project`  
**Default branch:** `main`

## Audit scope

This audit reviews the current GitHub repository structure, Maven configuration, documented architecture, database/deployment configuration, security hardening, RTU syllabus mapping, testing/CI configuration, and deployment readiness.

> Local execution results are reported separately from repository inspection. The developer has completed full local testing and reports the application is working correctly.

## Executive result

**Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT PREPARATION**

The repository contains the intended ShopSphere Advanced Java e-commerce application, the RTU syllabus demonstration modules, database scripts, deployment template, security hardening, tests, and CI workflow.

### Confirmed from repository

- Java 17 Maven target.
- WAR packaging for Tomcat deployment.
- Jakarta Servlet 6.1 and JSP/JSTL dependencies.
- MySQL JDBC driver.
- Layered Browser → JSP/HTML/JS → Servlet → Service → DAO → JDBC → MySQL architecture.
- Customer commerce workflow.
- Admin management workflow.
- Security hardening.
- RTU Advanced Java demonstration modules.
- Maven test/package CI workflow.
- Tomcat JNDI datasource deployment template.
- Phase documentation through Phases 46–60.
- RTU mapping, architecture, final report outline and viva checklist.

## Functional audit

### Customer

- Registration
- Login/logout
- Profile
- Password change
- Product listing
- Search
- Sorting
- Pagination
- Product details
- Reviews/ratings
- Cart
- Wishlist
- Saved addresses
- Coupons
- Checkout
- Local/mock payment recording
- Order history
- Customer-owned order details

### Admin

- Dashboard
- Category management
- Product/inventory management
- Customer management
- Account safety protections
- Order management
- Review moderation
- Sales analytics
- Coupon management
- CSV order export

## Security audit

The repository contains the following hardening measures:

- PBKDF2 password hashing.
- Password complexity policy.
- PreparedStatement-based database access.
- Server-side input validation.
- Same-origin CSRF protection.
- Security headers and CSP.
- Authentication and admin authorization filters.
- Session timeout and cookie-only tracking.
- No-store handling for session-backed responses.
- Login attempt throttling.
- Customer ownership checks.
- Admin self-lockout/last-admin protections.
- Correlation/request logging.
- DB-backed health endpoint.

### Credential handling

The current repository no longer stores the real local database password in the tracked deployment template. The deployment template uses `CHANGE_ME`.

Important: a previously committed credential may still exist in older public Git history. If that credential was real and still valid, rotate it before exposing the database/server to the internet.

For deployment, credentials must be supplied outside source control through the server's JNDI configuration or deployment secret/environment mechanism.

## Build and CI audit

Maven configuration:

- Java release: 17
- Packaging: WAR
- Servlet API: provided dependency
- MySQL Connector/J
- JSTL API + implementation
- JUnit Jupiter
- Maven compiler, WAR and Surefire plugins

GitHub Actions runs:

```text
mvn -B clean test package
```

using Temurin Java 17.

## Advanced Java / RTU audit

The repository maps the requested Advanced Java topics to implementation evidence including:

- Swing / Swing MVC
- MVC / N-tier architecture
- JDBC
- java.net client/server
- URLConnection
- RMI / Registry
- Serialization
- Internationalization
- Jakarta Servlet + JSP
- ServletConfig / ServletContext
- Sessions / cookies
- Filters / listeners
- JSP / EL / JSTL
- JSP fragments / tag files
- JNDI
- Security

Applets are documented as a historical topic rather than treated as a modern deployable feature.

## Deployment audit

Current deployment model:

1. Maven builds `target/shopsphere.war`.
2. WAR is deployed to Apache Tomcat 11.
3. MySQL provides the `shopsphere` database.
4. Tomcat JNDI resource name is `jdbc/ShopSphereDB`.
5. `DBConnection` checks JNDI first and supports documented environment-variable fallback.

The repository includes `deploy/tomcat/context.xml` as a safe template. It contains `CHANGE_ME` rather than a real password.

## Known project limitations

These are documented project-scope limitations, not deployment blockers:

- Payment is local/mock recording, not a live payment gateway.
- Login throttling is in-memory and intended for the student project.
- Advanced Java modules are focused syllabus demonstrations.
- Production-grade distributed observability and infrastructure are future scope.

## Final audit checklist

- [x] Source structure present
- [x] Maven WAR configuration
- [x] Java 17 target
- [x] Database scripts
- [x] Customer workflow
- [x] Admin workflow
- [x] Security hardening
- [x] Advanced Java modules
- [x] Automated tests
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow
- [x] Deployment template
- [x] RTU mapping
- [x] Architecture documentation
- [x] Final report documentation
- [x] Viva checklist
- [x] Repository credential removed from current source tree
- [ ] Production hosting selected
- [ ] Production MySQL provisioned
- [ ] Production JNDI/secret configuration
- [ ] Public deployment smoke test
- [ ] Domain/HTTPS configuration, if required

## Conclusion

The codebase is ready to move from **development/testing** into **deployment preparation**. The next work should focus on infrastructure and deployment configuration rather than adding more application features.
